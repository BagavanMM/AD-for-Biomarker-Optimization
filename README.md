*We propose that BenchSci implements an ML-powered adaptive design (AD) platform for making biomarker-ADs understandable and easily adaptable for researchers. Our model is separated into two parts; our preclinical model improves upon BenchSciâ€™s current biomarker/reagent selection process, and our clinical model would use machine learning to modify patient separation thresholds through adaptive designs with a Bayesian Optimization algorithm.*
